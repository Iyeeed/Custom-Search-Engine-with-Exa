# Custom-Search-Engine-with-Exa
In this project, we'll build a custom search engine using an API with LLM capabilities! ðŸš€
LLMs (short for large language models) are a powerful tool within the broader field of NLP. These models are trained on insane amounts of data and can grasp the intricacies of human language. ðŸ¤¯ A popular LLM that you might already be using is GPT-3.

Exa (formerly "Metaphor") is an API (application programming interface) that retrieves the best content on the web. With Exa, anyone can semantically search the web to get high-quality, relevant information. With Exa's technology, we can rediscover the content on the internet.
 we will use Exa's capabilities to build a basic search engine that can help you find exactly what you are searching for.
